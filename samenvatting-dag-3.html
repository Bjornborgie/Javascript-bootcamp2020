<h1>Day 3</h1>
<h3>Coding train Array</h3>
<p>Array is an list of values, order is what matters compared to objects. In an array you count from 0
    You can put anything in to an array: objects, numbers, variables. Built around the array if you try to reach an
    element that doesn'<table>
        exist yet. You can see the current length of the array by nameArray.length


</p>

var nums = [50,71,12,-22];

nums[2]Pull the value 12 out of the array



<h3>Coding train objects</h3>

<p>Objects are a way to organize your code, when a lot of variables are about the same element for example a circle
    you can put these in an object.
</p>


<p>Circle is the container for the variables x y and diameter, if you need the variable of x you should use dot notation
    as is seen at line 33</p>

var circle = {
x: 0,
y:100,
diameter:50


};

circle.x


<h3>Data Structures: Objects and Arrays</h3>

<h5>Expressions</h5>
<p>Expressions as .length give acces to the property of the value almost all Javascript expressions has properties
    except 0 and undefined. there are 2 main ways to acces a property:
    <ol>
        <li>with a dot like value.x</li>
        <li>and brackets likevalue[x]</li>
    </ol>
    but not necessarily the same property. the dot notation looks literally for the name after the dot, with square
    bracketsexpression between the brackets is evaluated. elements in an array are stored as the array properties, using numbers as property names
you cant use the dot notation for numbers.  So the name of the array is for example 0 = "test". The array length tells us 
how many properties the array has, so that,s why we write array.length.

</p>

<h5>Methods</h5>
<p>Both string and array values contain, in addition to the length property, a number of properties that hold function values. toUppercase is a good example, when it is called it will convert a copy of the string in uppercases after is has send it to its function.
    Properties that contain functions are called methods.
</p>

<p>.push ads number 4 at the end of the array, .pop removes the last value of the array</p>
    sequence.push(4);
    sequence.pop();

    <h5>Objects</h5>
<p>Reading a property that doesn't exist in an object will give undefined
    It is possible to delete properties by the delete binary it goed like this:delete anObject.left;

</p>


<h5>Objects mutability</h5>

<p>The reason that console.log(object1 == object3);= false is that object 1 refers to another identity
    </p>
let object1 = {value: 10};
        let object2 = object1;
        let object3 = {value: 10};
        
        console.log(object1 == object2);
        // → true
        console.log(object1 == object3);
        // → false
